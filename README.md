# Nanotrasen Simulator

_You are an AI trained to manage Nanotrasen when there is no-one left to manage it. This is a simulation to make sure you can do it properly._

A [universal paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/)-like game set in the Space Station 13 universe with you playing as an AI in a simulation.

## What is this?

Idle clicker game thing set in the Space Station 13 universe, check SS13 out. It's fun.

## Contributors

NT Simulator is massive spaghetti code, with barely anything documented. I'd appreciate if you made documentation instead of content PRs. Thanks.

*Side note*

You require a webserver to run NT Simulator as `fetch` on an HTML file on firefox breaks shit. Use something like a VSCode Live Server.
